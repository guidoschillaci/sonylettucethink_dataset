***How to use it***

Cam_sim can be used to simulate visuo-motor trajectories on a dataset recorded from the Sony LettuceThink micro-farming platform (http://romi-project.eu)
The dataset can be downloaded from the following Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/record/3552827#.Xk2v4xNKiRs

After cloning this github repository, create a folder within it called raw_images and extract the jpeg files contained in the zenodo zip archive.
Then run:
python cam_sim.py

to generate a pkl archive.
Finally, you can use cam_sim to generate simulated trajectories over the visuomotor dataset. 

See example.py for an simple test on how to generate trajectories
